## Credits

In this course, Iâ€™ve gained a solid foundation in building iOS apps using SwiftUI. I started with the basics... understanding variables, data types, and how to structure my code. Then, I explored SwiftUIâ€™s powerful declarative syntax, learning how to design interfaces using stacks (VStack, HStack, and ZStack) to arrange views.

I also dove into state management, using @State for local view changes, @Binding to share data between views, and @Environment to access system-wide settings. SwiftUIâ€™s modifiers helped me customize views with just a few lines of code, making styling and layout adjustments simple.
